# LinkedIn Job Automation Bot\n\nThis project consists of a Python Flask backend for automating LinkedIn job applications using Selenium and a React frontend built with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for interacting with the bot.\n\n## Requirements\n\nTo run this project, you need to have the following installed:\n\n**General:**\n\n*   **Google Chrome Browser:** Selenium requires a Chrome browser to run the automation.\n*   **ChromeDriver:** A compatible version of ChromeDriver must be installed and accessible in your system's PATH. You can download it from [https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). Make sure the version matches your installed Chrome browser version.\n\n**Backend (Python):**\n\n*   **Python 3.7+:** The backend is written in Python.\n*   **pip:** Python's package installer (usually comes with Python). Version will depend on your Python installation.\n\n**Frontend (React):**\n\n*   **Node.js:** Recommended LTS version. Includes npm (Node Package Manager). Version will depend on your Node.js installation.\n*   **npm (or yarn):** Package manager for JavaScript dependencies.\n\n## Dependencies and Versions\n\n**Backend (See `backend/requirements.txt`):**\n\n*   `Flask`\n*   `selenium`\n*   `smtplib` (Built-in)\n*   `email` (Built-in)\n*   `json` (Built-in)\n*   `os` (Built-in)\n*   `re` (Built-in)\n*   `flask-cors`\n\n**Frontend (See `job-bot-ui/package.json`):**\n\n*   `react`: `^19.1.0`\n*   `react-dom`: `^19.1.0`\n*   `react-scripts`: `5.0.1`\n*   `tailwindcss`: `^3.3.2`\n*   `postcss`: `^8.4.24`\n*   `autoprefixer`: `^10.4.14`\n*   `lucide-react`: (version installed by npm)\n*   `@radix-ui/react-slot`: (version installed by npm)\n*   `class-variance-authority`: (version installed by npm)\n*   `clsx`: (version installed by npm)\n*   `tailwind-merge`: (version installed by npm)\n*   `@radix-ui/react-label`: (version installed by npm)\n\n## Project Setup\n\nFollow these steps to set up and run the project:\n\n1.  **Clone or download the project files.**\n\n2.  **Set up the Backend:**\n    a.  Open a terminal or command prompt.\n    b.  Navigate to the `backend` directory:\n        ```bash\n        cd path/to/your/project/backend\n        ```\n    c.  Install the required Python packages:\n        ```bash\n        pip install -r requirements.txt\n        ```\n    d.  Ensure ChromeDriver is installed and in your system's PATH.\n    e.  Start the Flask backend server:\n        ```bash\n        python app.py\n        ```\n    f.  Keep this terminal window open and running.\n\n3.  **Set up the Frontend:**\n    a.  Open a *new* terminal window.\n    b.  Navigate to the `job-bot-ui` directory:\n        ```bash\n        cd path/to/your/project/job-bot-ui\n        ```\n    c.  Install the required Node.js packages:\n        ```bash\n        npm install\n        ```\n    d.  Start the React development server:\n        ```bash\n        npm start\n        ```\n    e.  Your browser should open automatically to `http://localhost:3000` (or a similar address). Keep this terminal window open as well.\n\n4.  **Run the Bot:**\n    a.  With both the backend server and the frontend development server running, go to the frontend UI in your browser (`http://localhost:3000`).\n    b.  Fill in your LinkedIn email and password, your email address and app password, and the job keywords.\n    c.  Click the "Run Bot" button.\n\nObserve the output in both the frontend console (for basic request info) and, more importantly, the **backend terminal** for the bot's progress, messages, and any potential errors during the Selenium automation.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n*   **ModuleNotFoundError (Python):** Make sure you are in the `backend` directory when running `pip install -r requirements.txt` and `python app.py`, and that you are using the correct Python environment.\n*   **Module not found (Frontend):** Ensure you are in the `job-bot-ui` directory when running `npm install` and `npm start`. Clear npm cache (`npm cache clean --force`) and reinstall if needed. Check `jsconfig.json` for path aliases (`@/`).\n*   **Selenium Errors (e.g., WebDriverException):** Ensure ChromeDriver is installed, is the correct version for your Chrome browser, and is added to your system's PATH. Check the backend terminal for specific Selenium error messages.\n*   **"Something went wrong. Try again." (Frontend):** This usually means the frontend couldn't connect to or got an error from the backend. Check if the backend server is running (look at its terminal) and if there are any errors printed there when you click the button (CORS issues, backend errors, etc.).\n*   **CORS Errors:** If you see CORS errors in your browser's developer console, ensure `flask-cors` is installed (`pip install flask-cors`) and `CORS(app)` is added to your `backend/app.py`.\n*   **Bot not applying (Backend):** Watch the backend terminal and the Chrome browser window opened by Selenium. Identify the last successful step or the first error message printed in the terminal. The Selenium locators might be outdated for LinkedIn's current website structure.\n\n---\n\nFeel free to contribute or report issues!
